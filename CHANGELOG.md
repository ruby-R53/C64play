- `CHANGELOG.md` exists
- The UI changes dynamically according to the number of SIDs from

    now doesn't appear for those tunes, only if they use more chips.

  on the configuration file instead of keeping it hard-coded.
  - Gotta learn how PulseAudio works better now!

September 12 (?), 2024:
- The `Subtune` field now becomes `On loop?` if the file is a single
  tune.
