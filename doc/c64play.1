.SH NAME
C64play \- a SID emulator for playing C64 tunes based on sidplayfp
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBc64play\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIfile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBC64play\fR is rather a front-end to libsidplayfp, which is where
the actual magic happens. libsidplayfp emulates an accurate C64
environment for playing SID tunes, using the reSID emulation en\-
gine by default, which is based on reSID, a project made by the
VICE team to reverse-engineer the SID chip and provide the best
possible emulation for it on modern computers.
.PP
C64play is currently in heavy development, it first started as
a simple fork of sidplayfp called \fIsidplayfp\-red_M95\fR and now
will be a more sophisticated project. Still nothing big, as the
current developer is a beginner and there's currently no one
else to contribute.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Displays a help message, showing you the options plus a brief
description for each of them.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help-debug"
Displays a help message for debugging-related options, plug a
brief description for each.
.IP \fB\-f\fR\fI<num>\fR 4
.IX Item "-f<num>"
Set sample rate for audio output, in Hz. Defaults to 48000 Hz.
.IP \fB\-nf\fR 4
.IX Item "-nf"
Disable SID filter emulation. Helps with speed on lower-end
hardware at the cost of emulation quality.
.IP \fB\-o\fR\fI<num>\fR 4
.IX Item "-o<num>"
Select starting track index number. Default is provided by the
file itself.
.IP \fB\-s\fR 4
.IX Item "-s"
Enable stereo playback. This is the default when loading a 2SID
tune, where SID #1 is panned to the left channel and SID #2 to
the right one. For 3SID tunes, the panning is the same and SID #3
is panned to the center.
.IP \fB\-m\fR 4
.IX Item "-m"
Enable mono playback.
.IP \fB\-v|q\fR[level] 4
.IX Item "-v|q[level]"
Either a [v]erbose output or a [q]uiet one. Takes an optional [level],
ranging from 1 to 3 on both cases. The level defaults to 1 if not 
specified.
.IP \fB\-b\fR\fI<num>\fR 4
.IX Item "-b<num>"
Set where to start in [min:]sec[.mil] format. Can also be used when
recording to a WAV file.
.IP \fB\-D\fR\fI<addr>\fR 4
.IX Item "-D<addr>"
Forces a 2SID environment by adding a second SID at <addr>. It forces
a stereo playback, and can be useful for raw .prg files as there's
currently no way to properly identify them. For MUS and SID files
however, the 2nd SID is already identified.
.Sp
SID #2 can go on addresses 0xD420 \- 0xD7FF or 0xDE00 \- 0xDFFF. The
address can be specified in either hexadecimal (with the 0x prefix)
or decimal format.
.IP \fB\-T\fR\fI<addr>\fR 4
.IX Item "-T<addr>"
Adds a third SID at <addr>. Same thing as \fB\-D\fR.
.IP \fB\-m\fR\fI<num|char>\fR 4
.IX Item "-m<num|char>"
Start playing with channel <num> muted. Can be used more than once at
a time, which can be handy for dumping individual channels.
.Sp
Channels 1 to 3 are for SID #1, 4 to 6 for SID #2, and 7 to 9 for SID #3.
.Sp
Moreover, using 'a' to 'c' makes it mute sample playback, from SID #1 to
SID #3 respectively.
.IP \fB\-p\fR\fI<num>\fR 4
.IX Item "-p<num>"
Set bit depth when recording to a file. You may use either 16 for a
signed 16\-bit output, or 32 for a 32\-bit float one. Defaults to 16.
.IP \fB\-o\fR\fI<l|s|<num>>\fR 4
.IX Item "-o<l|s|<num>>"
Track options:
Use \fIl\fR to make the selected track loop.
Use \fIs\fR to select only one of the subtunes from <file> and play it,
ignoring the rest.
And use \fI<num\fR> to make playback start at a specific subtune from
<file>.
.IP \fB\-t\fR\fI<num>\fR 4
.IX Item "-t<num>"
Set play time, in [min:]sec[.mil] format. Use 0 for infinite play time.
.IP \fB\-v\fR\fI<n|p>[f]\fR 4
.IX Item "-v<n|p>[f]"
Set or [f]orce a video signal for the VIC chip.
Use \fIn\fR for NTSC, commonly used in America, with a 60 Hz signal.
And use \fIp\fR for PAL, commonly used in Europe, with a 50 Hz signal.
Note that not forcing a video signal triggers a signal fix. On a
real C64 this doesn't happen, so adding [f] simulates the real
behavior.
.IP \fB\-m\fR\fI<o|n>[f]\fR 4
.IX Item "-m<o|n>[f]"
Set or [f]orce SID chip to be used.
Use \fIo\fR for the old 6581 model.
And use \fIn\fR for the newer 8580 one.
.IP \fB\-\-digiboost\fR 4
.IX Item "--digiboost"
Enable DigiBost, a hack for the 8580 SID chip to make samples
audible.
.IP \fB\-r\fR\fI<i|r>[f]\fR 4
.IX Item "-r<i|r>[f]"
Set resampling method. If using the reSID engine, [f]ast sampling
is supported.
Use \fIi\fR for Resample interpolate, which prioritizes speed over
accuracy.
And use \fIr\fR for Resample, which prioritizes accuracy over speed.
.IP "\fB\-w, \-\-wav\fR\fI[name]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w, --wav[name]"
Record selected tune to a WAV file. The default file name is
<file>[subtune].wav, where [subtune] appears if the file has more
than one subtune. By providing [name], the .wav extension is added
automatically.
.IP \fB\-\-au\fR\fI[name]\fR 4
.IX Item "--au[name]"
Record selected tune to an AU file. Uses the same naming convention
as \fI\-w\fR.
.IP \fB\-\-resid\fR 4
.IX Item "--resid"
Use the reSID emulation engine, made by the VICE project.
.IP \fB\-\-residfp\fR 4
.IX Item "--residfp"
Use the reSIDfp emulation engine, which is the default.
.IP \fB\-\-cpu\-debug\fR 4
.IX Item "--cpu-debug"
Display CPU registers and assembly dumps, only available in
debug builds.
.IP \fB\-\-delay=\fR\fI[num]\fR 4
.IX Item "--delay=[num]"
Simulate a power-on delay on the C64 in CPU cycles. If [num]
is greater than 8191, the delay will be randomly generated,
which is the default.
.IP \fB\-\-fcurve=\fR\fI<num>|auto\fR 4
.IX Item "--fcurve=<num>|auto"
Sets the filter curve on the reSIDfp emulation engine. Ranges
from 0.0 ("light") to 1.0 ("dark"). Defaults to 0.5, and can
also [auto]matically select a value according to the tune's
author.
.IP \fB\-\-frange=\fR\fI<num>|auto\fR 4
.IX Item "--frange=<num>|auto"
For libsidplayfp v2.7.0 and higher. Controls the filter range
value for the 6581 chip in reSIDfp emulation.
.IP \fB\-\-noaudio\fR 4
.IX Item "--noaudio"
Don't use an audio output device.
.IP \fB\-\-nosid\fR 4
.IX Item "--nosid"
Don't emulate a SID.
.IP \fB\-\-none\fR 4
.IX Item "--none"
Don't emulate both the SID and also don't use an audio output
device.
