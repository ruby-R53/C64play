=head1 NAME

c64play.ini - configuration file for L<C64play(1)>.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C64play has a configuration file formed by sections. They're names enclosed by brackets, making it easier to separate each type of setting.
Every setting has a <name> = <value> structure.

B<c64play.ini> has the following sections:

B<[C64play]> - Player settings

B<[Console]> - Console output settings

B<[Audio]> - Audio output settings

B<[Emulation]> - Emulation parameters

If a setting is specified more than once, the last iteration of it will be used by the program.

And B<note> that, if any of those settings are outside of their respective section, it will be ignored.

=over

=item B<Version>=I<< <number> >>

Configuration file version. This might get dropped in a future release.

=item B<Songlength DB>=I<< <path> >>

Full path for the Songlength database.
By default, the program will look for a file named F<DOCUMENTS/Songlengths.md5> under the HVSC path, if $HVSC_BASE is set.
If this variable is not set, C64play will try F<$PREFIX/share/C64play/Songlengths.md5> instead.

=item B<Default play time>=I<MM:SS.mmm>

Default play time if Songlengths.md5 isn't found. Defaults to 0, which means infinite play time.

=item B<Default record time>=I<MM:SS.mmm>

Default recording time when recording to WAV if Songlengths.md5 isn't found. Defaults to 5 minutes.

=item B<Kernal ROM>=I<< <path> >>

Full path for the Kernal ROM file. Out of all the 2 other ROMs, this is the most important, and thus should be provided as some tunes may not play without it.
By default, the program will look for a file named F<kernal> under the following places:

=over

=item * $XDG_DATA_HOME/C64play/

on systems where $XDG_DATA_HOME is set;

=item * $HOME/.local/share/C64play/

on systems where $XDG_DATA_HOME isn't set, and

=item * $PREFIX/share/C64play

if not found in any of the directories above.

=back

=item B<BASIC ROM>=I<< <path> >>

Full path for the BASIC ROM file. This is mostly useful for playing tunes made in BASIC.
By default the program will look for a file named F<basic> under the same locations as above.

=item B<Chargen ROM>=I<< <path> >>

Full path for the Character generator ROM file. Almost useless for actually playing tunes, but included for completeness.
By default the program will look for a file named F<chargen> under the same locations as above too.

=item B<Output level>=I<< <number> >>

Console output level:
0 is the default output level.
Use 1 for a verbose output.
Use 2 for a more verbose output.
Use 3 for an even more verbose output.
Use -1 for a quiet output.
Use -2 for a quieter output.
Use -3 for an even quieter output.

=back


=head2 Console

=over

=item B<ANSI>=I<true|false>

Use ANSI escape sequences to provide a fancier output (it adds colors and hides the console cursor).

=item B<Top left char>=I<< <char> >>

Character for the top left corner.

=item B<Top right char>=I<< <char> >>

Character for the top right corner.

=item B<Bottom left char>=I<< <char> >>

Character for the bottom left corner.

=item B<Bottom right char>=I<< <char> >>

Character for the bottom right corner.

=item B<Vertical char>=I<< <char> >>

Character for vertical lines.

=item B<Horizontal char>=I<< <char> >>

Character for horizontal lines.

=item B<Junction left char>=I<< <char> >>

Character for junctions on the left.

=item B<Junction right char>=I<< <char> >>

Character for junctions on the right.

=back


=head2 Audio

=over

=item B<Sample rate>=I<< <number> >>

Playback sample rate in Hz. Default is 48000.

=item B<Channels>=I<< <number> >>

Number of channels:
Use 1 for mono playback.
Use 2 for stereo playback.
If not specified, C64play will use mono playback on single-SID tunes
and stereo playback on 2 or 3SID ones.

=item B<Bit depth>=I<< <16|32> >>

Number of bits per sample, used for wav output only.

=back


=head2 Emulation

=over

=item B<Engine>=I<< <RESIDFP|RESID|HARDSID|EXSID|NONE> >>

Set the SID emulation engine. Defaults to RESIDFP.

=item B<Video mode>=I<< <PAL|NTSC|OLD_NTSC|DREAN> >>

Default video signal to use if not specified by tune:
PAL for the European PAL-B model;
NTSC for American/Japanese NTSC-M models;
and OLD_NTSC for NTSC-M models with the old VIC chip and DREAN
for the Argentinian PAL-N model. Defaults to PAL.

=item B<Force video mode>=I<true|false>

Use the same video mode even if the tune specifies one.

=item B<CIA version>=I<< <MOS6526|MOS8521> >>

Select which CIA chip to emulate, the old MOS 6526 or the newer MOS 8521.

=item B<SID version>=I<< <MOS6581|MOS8580> >>

Default SID chip model, the old MOS 6581 or the newer MOS 8580.

=item B<Force SID version>=I<true|false>

Use the same version of the SID chip even if the tune specifies one.

=item B<DigiBoost>=I<true|false>

Enable DigiBoost, a hack for the 8580 SID chip to make samples audible.

=item B<Filter emulation>=I<true|false>

Enable/disable the emulation of the SID filter.

=item B<Filter bias>=I<< <number> >>

Controls the SID's bias on reSID's emulation.
Ranges from 0.0 ("dark") to 1.0 ("light"), defaults to 0.5.

=item B<6581 filter curve>=I<< <number> >>

Controls the SID's filter curve on reSIDfp's emulation.
Ranges from 0.0 ("dark") to 1.0 ("bright"), defaults to 0.5.

=item B<6581 filter range>=I<< <number> >>

Controls the filter's uCox parameter for the 6581 chip on reSIDfp's
emulation.
Ranges from 0.0 ("dark") to 1.0 ("bright"), defaults to 0.5.

=item B<8580 filter curve>=I<< <number> >>

Controls the filter curve for the 8580 model on reSIDfp's
emulation. 
Ranges from 0.0 ("light") to 1.0 ("dark"), defaults to 0.5.

=item B<Combined wave strength>=I<< <AVERAGE|WEAK|STRONG> >>

Controls the combined waveforms strength on reSIDfp's
emulation. Defaults to AVERAGE.

=item B<Power-on delay>=I<< <number> >>

Simulates the C64's power-on delay in CPU cycles.
If <number> is higher than 8191, that delay will be randomly generated, and
that's the default.

=item B<Resampling>=I<< <INTERPOLATE|RESAMPLE> >>

Set resampling method.
Use I<INTERPOLATE> for a speedier output;
and I<RESAMPLE> for a more accurate one at the cost of hardware resources.

=item B<reSID's fast sampling>=I<< <true|false> >>

Enable reSID's fast resampling.
