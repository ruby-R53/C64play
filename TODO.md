# TODO

- Optimize text output for better performance and efficiency.
  - I might replace those awkward ANSI escape codes with ncurses 
    on a future major release.

- Add a keyboard shortcut to open a tune so that quitting the player
  is not necessary.
  - 2025-02-10: I still couldn't figure that out x)
