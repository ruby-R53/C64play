# C64play

A music player for Commodore 64 tunes, based on [sidplayfp](https://github.com/libsidplayfp/sidplayfp).

See what I've done plus the requirements for this program down below!

### What I added

- Extra displays:
  - Master volume;
  - Active filters;
  - Filtered channels;
  - Filter resonance;
  - Filter cutoff;
  - With the exception of the 2nd and 3rd items, they're displayed in binary.
- Changes to the keybinds:
  - Replay a tune by hitting the `r` key.
  - YouTube player-like keybinds:
    - Hit `j` to go to the previous subtune;
    - `k` to pause a subtune;
    - and `l` to go to the next subtune.
  - Hit `g` to jump to a specific subtune instead of repeatedly hitting `j` or `k`.
  - Hit `=` to double the playback speed of a tune.
    - You can then hit `-` to halve it;
    - Or `0` to go all the way back to the normal speed!
- Other visual changes:
  - Changes to the color palette.
  - You can now see the filter curve and/or range value on the main UI.
  - The `DigiBoost` field now only appears if a tune uses the 8580 chip.
  - The console cursor is now hidden.
  - Prefix a `~` to the note if the frequency doesn't match one of
    the ones in the frequency table.
  - Slightly wider interface, as a result of my additions to the UI.
  - Replaced the `+` character from the sides to `:`.
  - The configuration file automatically generated by the program doesn't have
    an extra empty line at the end.

### What I removed

- Support for Windows:
  - I'm thinking of making a new UI for that.
  - Plus, as I'm still a beginner, I needed to simplify stuff...
- Display configuration file location
  - I didn't find any use for this, as there's no command-line option
    to load a custom configuration file and the file is always loaded
	from the same location ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- STILView
  - Never used it, didn't wanna take care of something I never messed
    with...

### Requirements

- autotools
- libsidplayfp (version 2.0.0 or higher)
- pod2man
- patience
- and a decent computer to better enjoy the emulation!
