# C64play

A music player for Commodore 64 tunes, based on [sidplayfp](https://github.com/libsidplayfp/sidplayfp).

See what I've done down below and see how you can contribute to the project!

### What I added

- Extra displays:
  - Master volume;
  - Active filters;
  - Filtered channels;
  - Filter resonance;
  - Filter cutoff;
  - With the exception of the 2nd and 3rd items, they're displayed in binary.
- Changes to the keybinds:
  - Replay a tune by hitting the `r` key.
  - YouTube player-like keybinds:
    - Hit `j` to go to the previous subtune;
    - `k` to pause a subtune;
    - and `l` to go to the next subtune.
  - Hit `g` to jump to a specific subtune instead of repeatedly hitting `j` or `k`.
  - Hit `=` to double the playback speed of a tune.
    - You know I actually meant `+`, but pressing shift is kinda awkward,
	  so I just made it `=` instad.
    - You can then hit `-` to halve it;
    - Or `0` to go all the way back to the normal speed!
- Other visual changes:
  - Changes to the color palette.
  - You can now see the filter curve and/or range value on the main UI.
  - The `DigiBoost` field now only appears if a tune uses the 8580 chip.
  - The console cursor is now hidden.
  - Prefix a `~` to the note if the frequency doesn't match one of
    the ones in the frequency table.
  - Slightly wider interface, as a result of my additions to the UI.
  - Replaced the `+` character from the sides to `:`.
  - The configuration file automatically generated by the program doesn't have
    an extra empty line at the end.

### What I removed

- Support for Windows
  - I'm thinking of making a new UI for that.
  - Plus, as I'm still a beginner, I needed to simplify stuff...
- Display configuration file location
  - I didn't find any use for this, as there's no command-line option
    to load a custom configuration file and the file is always loaded
	from the same location ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- STILView
  - Never used it, didn't wanna take care of something I never messed
    with...
- Support for emulating with a real SID (e.g. exSID)
  - I'm actually only *considering* to drop support for those, as I currently
    don't have any of those devices. However, if you, the reader, do have at
	least one of them, lemme know! (as if an enthusiast would actually see
	my project at all, not sure why I'm writing this...)
  - UPDATE (2024/7/7): I found out that HardSID support is untested on
    libsidplayfp. Why bother?? xD
- AU file support
  - I only knew this file format existed after digging into sidplayfp's source
    code, really. I've never seen it being used at all, and it's an old one.
	Most software nowadays are probably incompatible with it.

### Contributing

If you have any ideas to enhance the program, found any bugs, wanna point out
a detail that I missed, or just ask a question, feel free to open an issue or
make a pull request, that would be very appreciated!!

But just by using this program you're already contributing to it in a way tho'
:)
